# 🛠️ Scripts

This repository contains a curated collection of my personal scripts, written in Python, Bash, and other scripting languages. These scripts are used for automation, system administration, development utilities, and general productivity improvements.

## 📁 Structure

* `bash/` – Shell scripts for automation, system tasks, etc.
* `python/` – Python scripts for tools, utilities, or automation.
* `tools/` – One-off utilities or experimental prototypes.
* `README.md` – Overview of available scripts and usage instructions.

## 🚀 Goals

* Centralized storage of reusable scripts
* Version control and history tracking
* Easy reuse across devices and environments

## 🧩 Planned Additions

* Better logging/output formatting
* Command-line argument parsing
* Script documentation and examples
